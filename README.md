# SmartPrintScreen
A program that enhances the PrintScreen key with some new features.

# Features
1. Each time you take a screenshot with the PrintScreen key it gets uploaded on imgur.com anonymously  
and copies the uploaded image URL to the clipboard.  
Then you can just paste the URL in any IM service to share with your friends.  
Screenshot URLs are listed in the application and you are able to remove them if necessary.
2. Holding the Win key and clicking PrintScreen will let you cut a screenshot before uploading.  
Holding the primary mouse key move the cursor to the other location to set the cutting selection and then release it.  
The cut modifier keys can be changed to any of those keys or even their combo: Ctrl, Shift and Win.

The latest release could be found in "releases" tab.
